<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
In this lab we replace weather placeholder with data from weather API, that is requested by our back-end server, and then processed and sent back to front-end. We also add info about movies whose title contains the name of the city we searched for.
