In this lab we modularize back-end and front-end, refactoring our codebase.

## Getting Started

- Set up a new server.

- compose a url to request data from back-end.

- Handle the request from front-end using .find(), then popualting an array with necessary data.

- Send the data to front-end.

- Display the results using react-bootstrap

- code try/catch to handle errors
