# City Explorer App (Lab 07)

**Author**: Ayrat Gimranov
**Version**: 1.0.2 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This lab teaches us to build our first back-end server. The app is pulling weather data from our locally built back-end and displaying the result by dates, as well as handling errors.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
- mpn install express, cors, dotenv.

- Set up a new server.

- compose a url to request data from back-end.

- Handle the request from front-end using .find(), then popualting an array with necessary data.

- Send the data to front-end.

- Display the results using react-bootstrap

- code try/catch to handle errors
